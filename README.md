Just finished a new chat app- deepchat 🟣

deepchat is an app in which userscan send messages and location to everyone present in the specific chatroom 👨‍💻. User can leave the chatrooms or enter into given chatrooms and communicate with other members.👥

There are no. of chatrooms like Javascript,Python,Php,Java,etc.
User can Join any chatroom but there can be no user with same name in a same chat room ❎

When user sends the message it will be communicated to every other members in the Chat room at the same time
And when the user leaves the room then also every member can see the message "\_\_ leaves the room" 🔚

It's a responsive application
While making this application I learned about socket.io and express .
I also learned how to deploy an application on the internet for free using render.com 💯
